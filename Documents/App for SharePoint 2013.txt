Visual Studio 2012 SharePoint 2013 templates - http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsFor2012
Communicating with SharePoint .... when opening apsx page for the 1st time

In SharePoint 2013, apps have their own identity and specific permissions
	- installing user (site collection admin) grants or denies permissions to the host web
	- permission is explicitly given for a specific scope (?)
	- app identity is passed around using oAuth tokens

Apps connect to SharePoint using
	- SharePoint 2013 Client Side Object Model (CSOM)
	- SharePoint 2013 REST API (oData protocol)
	- Javascript cross-domain library (SP.RequestExecutor.js) (C:\Program Files\SharePoint Client Components\Scripts)

REST URLs
	http://<sharepoint>/_api/web

	_api/web/lists
	_api/web/lists/list1
	_api/web/?$select=title,id
	/_api/web/lists/getByTitle("Consultants")/Items

Response data format: ATOM XML or JSON, with ACCEPT header
	use "application/json" to get JSON response

(
	use http://<sharepoint>/_vti_bin/client.svc/web to test SharePoint 2013 REST API responses 
	in Chrome, IE 9 is unable to display the returned XML document
)
